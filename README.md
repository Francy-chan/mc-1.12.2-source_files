# mc-1.12.2-source_files
Source files for Minecraft 1.12.2, since it's rather hard to find.

## About
These source files were generated via MCP, for your usage. I've set up this old MCP940 for 1.12 to work with 1.12.2. I zipped and committed the decompiled source files if you want to view them.

In `temp` you'll find the assets and a few various other files. And in `src` you'll find the unobfuscated source files. As of [edc8826](https://github.com/TheGrimSilence/mc-1.12.2-source_files/commit/edc8826a7c2c854ba3d52203523a937654bad2fa), the source files are available under their folders, and downloadable ZIPs.
