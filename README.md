# mc-1.12.2-source_files
Source files for Minecraft 1.12.2, since it's rather hard to find.

## About
These source files were generated via MCP, for your usage. The generated files proved too large to upload over git, 
so I've set up this old MCP940 for 1.12 to work with 1.12.2. I zipped and committed the decompiled source files if you want to view them. 
I may also include the unpacked source files in another repository for easier travelling.
